# DLP-EV-System-for-PA-Optimization
This system is a game-changer, enabling smarter energy management through predictive insights and personalized optimization strategies.
Our proposed system goes beyond simple monitoring by integrating electric vision technology with deep learning. By combining hardware like the ESP8266 microcontroller and the PZEM 004T sensor with advanced predictive models, we can forecast electricity consumption in real-time. Not only does this allow users to anticipate their energy needs, but it also provides customized recommendations on how to reduce consumption.
